# IRIS 2.0 - Mission Feasibility System

## Overview
IRIS 2.0 now includes an advanced mission feasibility analysis system that evaluates space missions before launching them. This creates a more realistic mission control experience where not every plan is automatically approved.

## New Features

### 1. Feasibility Analysis Engine
- **NASA Horizons Integration**: Real-time ephemeris data from NASA's JPL Horizons system
- **40% Success Threshold**: Missions below 40% success probability are automatically rejected
- **Comprehensive Calculations**: Delta-V, fuel requirements, time of flight, and success probability

### 2. Two-Step Mission Flow
1. **ANALYZE FEASIBILITY**: Check if the mission is viable
2. **LAUNCH MISSION**: Execute approved missions (only available after feasibility approval)

### 3. Mission History Tracking
- All successful missions are saved to a persistent history
- View past mission details including success rates and parameters
- Comprehensive mission dashboard

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/check-feasibility` - Analyze mission feasibility
- `GET /api/past-missions` - Retrieve mission history

### Updated Endpoints
- `POST /trajectory/simulate` - Now saves successful missions to history

## Mission Parameters

### Basic Parameters
- **Target**: Destination planet (Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mercury)
- **Duration**: Mission duration in days
- **Swarm Count**: Number of nanosatellites in the mission

### Advanced Parameters
- **Propulsion Type**: Chemical, Ion Drive, or Nuclear
- **Role Distribution**: Equal, Science Heavy, Communication Heavy, or Specialized

## Success Probability Factors

The system calculates success probability based on:
- **Swarm Size**: More nanosats = higher redundancy
- **Delta-V Requirements**: Higher delta-v = increased risk
- **Propulsion Efficiency**: Different propulsion types have different risk profiles
- **Role Distribution**: Mission role specialization affects success rates

## Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd app/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Optional: Add Gemini API key to `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Start the backend:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Frontend Features

### New Mission Planning Modal
- Enhanced UI with comprehensive mission parameters
- Real-time feasibility analysis
- Visual feedback for mission approval/rejection
- Detailed mission metrics display

### Mission Control Dashboard
- Integrated mission history panel
- Live mission status tracking
- Professional mission control interface

## Technical Implementation

### NASA Horizons Integration
The system integrates with NASA's Horizons API to fetch real-time ephemeris data for target objects. This ensures mission planning uses actual celestial mechanics data.

### Realistic Physics Calculations
- **Lambert Problem**: For trajectory optimization
- **Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation**: For fuel calculations
- **Hohmann Transfer**: For time of flight estimates

### Risk Assessment Model
The 40% success threshold creates realistic mission planning constraints, forcing users to optimize their mission parameters for success.

## Usage Example

1. Click "New Trajectory" to open mission planning
2. Configure mission parameters (target, swarm size, propulsion, etc.)
3. Click "ANALYZE FEASIBILITY" to check mission viability
4. If approved (â‰¥40% success), click "LAUNCH MISSION"
5. View completed missions in the Mission History panel

This system transforms IRIS from a simple simulation tool into a realistic mission control experience that teaches proper space mission planning principles.
